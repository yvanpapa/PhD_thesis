#I got a core dump when I asked for only 4G

#Specifying the GFF3 annotation file for the annotated complex repeats (rm_gff) has the effect of hard masking these repeats 
#so that they do not confound our ability to identify coding genes.
#We let MAKER identify simple repeats internally, since it will soft mask these, allowing them to be available for gene annotation.
#https://gist.github.com/darencard/bb1001ac1532dd4225b030cf0cd61ce2

#Regions identified during repeat analysis are masked out in two different ways:
#Complex repeats are hard-masked - the repeat sequence is replaced with the letter N. 
#This essentially removes this sequence from any further consideration at any later point of the annotation process.
#Simple repeats are soft-masked - sequences are transformed to lower case. 
#This prevents alignment programs such as Blast from seeding any new alignments in the soft-masked region, 
#however alignments that begin in a nearby (non-masked) region of the genome can extend into the soft-masked region.
#This is important because low-complexity regions are found within many real genes, they just don't make up the majority of the gene.
